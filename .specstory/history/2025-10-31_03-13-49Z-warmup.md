I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist.

I can help you with:

- **Finding files** using glob patterns (e.g., `*.js`, `src/**/*.tsx`)
- **Searching file contents** using regex patterns with grep
- **Reading specific files** when you know the exact path
- **Navigating directory structures** to understand your codebase

Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll efficiently search through `/Users/jill/claude-artifact-build` to find what you need.

What would you like me to search for?
