I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you search, explore, and analyze your codebase.

I can assist you with:

- **Glob searches** - Find files matching specific patterns across your project
- **Grep searches** - Search file contents using regex patterns
- **File reading** - View and analyze specific file contents
- **Bash operations** - List directories, check file structures, and perform file operations

I see you're working in `/Users/jill/claude-artifact-build`, which is a git repository on the master branch with recent activity around timeline scaling, logging, and drag-and-drop functionality.

What would you like me to help you find or explore in your codebase?

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I can see this is a React-based project with git status showing various markdown files and some HTML/TypeScript files.

Before we dive into a specific search task, let me give you a quick overview of what I can help with:

**My search capabilities:**
- **Glob** - Find files matching patterns (e.g., `*.tsx`, `**/*component*`)
- **Grep** - Search file contents using regex patterns
- **Read** - Read specific files when you know the exact path
- **Bash** - Run commands for file operations and directory listings

**What I can help you find:**
- Specific files or file types
- Code patterns or implementations
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Dependencies or imports
- Functions, classes, or components

I notice your working directory is `/Users/jill/claude-artifact-build` and you have a React application with some recent work on timeline scaling, drag-and-drop functionality, and sync debugging.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
