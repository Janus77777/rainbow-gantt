I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I can see this is a Claude Artifact build project with some recent work on drag-and-drop functionality.

To help you effectively, could you tell me what you're looking for? For example:

- **Find specific files** - I can locate files by name, extension, or pattern
- **Search code content** - I can find specific code patterns, functions, or text across files
- **Explore project structure** - I can help you understand the organization of your codebase
- **Locate recent changes** - I can help identify files that have been modified or added

What would you like me to search for or explore in your project?
