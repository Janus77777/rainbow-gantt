I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, equipped with powerful tools to navigate and explore your project.

I can see you're working in a git repository at `/Users/jill/claude-artifact-build` on macOS. The repo shows some recent activity around PDF-related changes and has uncommitted modifications to some history files and the dist/index.html.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase? I can:

- Find files matching specific patterns
- Search for code or text within files
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate directory structures

Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll get started!

# Warmup - 2025-10-31 02:45:51Z

## Summary
This is a warmup session to familiarize myself with the Claude Artifact Build project.

## Key Points
- Project uses TypeScript and Vite for building
- Contains src/, dist/, and pdf-viewer/ directories
- Recent commits show back-and-forth changes with dist/index.html and PDF-related updates
- The project appears to be in a state of stabilization after several reverts

## Current State
- Branch: master
- Modified files: .specstory/history/2025-10-30_19-51-03Z-warmup.md, .specstory/history/2025-10-31_02-45-51Z-warmup.md, dist/index.html
- Untracked: pdf-viewer/

## Next Steps
- Review the src/ directory structure
- Understand the build configuration
- Check package.json for dependencies and scripts
```
