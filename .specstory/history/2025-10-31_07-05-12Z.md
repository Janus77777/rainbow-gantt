I'd be happy to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for Claude's CLI. I'm ready to help you explore and search through your codebase.

I can assist with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code and text with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Understanding your project structure

Since you're in `/Users/jill/claude-artifact-build`, which appears to be a Git repository, I can help you locate specific files, understand the codebase structure, or search for particular code patterns.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your project?

I'm ready to help you search through your codebase! I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, or explore the structure of your project.

Based on the git status, I can see you have a React application with some recent work on task management and drag-and-drop sorting features.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
