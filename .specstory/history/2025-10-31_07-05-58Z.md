I'll help you with a warmup search! Let me explore the repository structure and recent activity to understand what we're working with.
<function_calls>
<invoke name="bash">
<parameter name="command">cd /Users/jill/claude-artifact-build && find . -type f -name "*.md" | grep -E "(specstory|warmup)" | head -20</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
<function_calls>
<invoke name="read">
<parameter name="path">/Users/jill/claude-artifact-build</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Let me check the warmup history files:
<function_calls>
<invoke name="bash">
<parameter name="command">ls -la /Users/jill/claude-artifact-build/.specstory/history/ | grep warmup</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

<function_calls>
<invoke name="read">
<parameter name="path">/Users/jill/claude-artifact-build/.specstory/history/2025-10-31_07-05-12Z-warmup.md</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
